## Description:
---
Aberrant Barter is an app where users can create a profile, and post items that they would be willing to trade. Other users will then post an offer with a different item that they want to trade for the item you have posted. Users are able to accept an offer that a user has posted and close out the trade. Creative and unusual trades is the premise of the app, so get Aberrant and start making some trades!

## For the future:

Possibilities are almost endless for an app like this. 


One main feature that I want to implement is a notification system where a user will receive an email when someone has made an offer on their trade, or an offer has been accepted.


Another feature is to allow users to tag and search posted trades. Making it easy to see if someone has posted what you are looking for.


Lastly, I would like for users to be able to chat one on one with each other, in order for faster trade acceptance and counter-offers.
